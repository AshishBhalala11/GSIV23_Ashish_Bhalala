### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Done everything that's been asked in the challenge that was required.

Done listing of the movies with search functionality.\
Done details page for a perticular movie details.\
Done infinite scrolling with next movies list data pagination wise.\
Rather then showing 2 lines of decsription of movie in movie card. on hovering over the card showinf decsription of movie dynamically which is great for UI and UX.

### I could've done more dynamic UI changes to make website even better for user interaction with more time.
